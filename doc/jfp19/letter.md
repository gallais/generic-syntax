We have highlighted the non-cosmetic changes with a bar of
colour in the margin. The colour of the bar corresponds to
the reviewer that motivated the change:

* blue  for reviewer 1
* red   for reviewer 2
* green for reviewer 3

# Debatted points

* We have added a paragraph explaining the programming style
  which led us to pick the same name for the arrow constructor
  and the constructor of the isArrow view.


# Additional extensions:

While addressing the remark by reviewer 3 inciting us to compare
and contrast Bach Poulsen et al.'s work with ours, we were reminded
of Cheney's ``Toward a general theory of names: binding and scope''
and added a discussion of the possible extensions this works suggests.
