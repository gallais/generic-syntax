\begin{abstract}
Almost every programming language's syntax includes a notion of binder
and corresponding bound occurrences, along with the accompanying
notions of $\alpha$-equivalence, capture-avoiding substitution, typing
contexts, runtime environments, and so on. In the past, implementing
and reasoning about programming languages required careful handling to
maintain the correct behaviour of bound variables. Modern programming
languages include features that enable constraints like scope safety
to be expressed in types. Nevertheless, the programmer is still forced
to write the same boilerplate over again for each new implementation
of a scope-safe operation (e.g., renaming, substitution, desugaring,
printing), and then again for correctness proofs.
We present an expressive universe of syntaxes with binding and
demonstrate how to (1) implement scope-safe traversals once and for
all by generic programming; and (2) how to derive properties of these
traversals by generic proving. Our universe description, generic
traversals and proofs, and our examples have all been formalised in
Agda and are available in the accompanying material available online
at \url{https://github.com/gallais/generic-syntax}.
