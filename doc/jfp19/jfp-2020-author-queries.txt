in the correct order and spelt correctly.
Q2: Please check that affiliations of all the authors and the corresponding author
details are correctly set.

Q4: Please check that the terms ‘type safe’ and ’scope safe’ have been changed to

JHM response:

In addition to the JFP-raised queries below (only partially answered, I am afraid), there are also the following typesetting fuck ups:

-- on pages 9--13 (section 3.2), occurrences of (agda-font) 'Semantics' and 'semantics' are all given trailing full-stops '.':

  l.260
  l.264
  l.269
  Fig.10, caption (as with other figures below, the full stop may be appropriate here, but should be queired; it may be the source of the spurious running-text full stops)
  l.294
  l.295
  l.297
  l.304
  Fig.11, caption
  Fig.13, caption
  l.358
  l.360
  l.364

-- page 54, l.1561, "our notion of Semantics", the word "Semantics" is not type set in agda-font

Seems correct to me. 

Q9: Would you consider changing the term ‘intrinsically typed simply typed’ to
’intrinsically simply typed’ in the sentence ‘Coming back...’. Please check and
correct if necessary.

No change need here, if you ask me, 

Q10: As per style, unpublished data should not be included in the reference list and
hence edited accordingly. Kindly check and confirm if the citations in text are

Look as though "(unpublished manuscript)" would be more appropriate here. 

Q11: Please provide “Acknowledgement”, if available.

No grant funding paid for this work at my end.

Q12: Please provide Conflicts of Interest.

This is new: what to write here?

Q13: Please provide page range for “Altenkirch et al. (2015a, 2015b).”

2015a: no page range --- online journal. "doi : 10.2168/LMCS-11(1:3)2015"

2015b: no page range --- online journal. "25" -> "25, e5. doi:10.1017/S095679681500009X"

Q14: Please provide complete details for “Atkey (2015).”

AFAICT, it was given at the Scottish Programming Languages Seminar, Strathclyde University, 18 February 2015.
(No entry on the main SPLS page for it; does someone at Strathclyde have an archived copy of the programme?)

Q15: Please check if the author names and initials in References are correctly set.

"Nathan Foster, J." should be "Foster, J.N.", IIUC

Q16: Please provide complete details for “Eisenberg (2018),” if available.

AFAICT, "Unpublished draft", which they won't like, so you could try the URLs instead:
https://richarde.dev/papers/2018/stitch/stitch.pdf,
https://richarde.dev/papers/2018/stitch/stitch.tar.gz
or else his publications page
