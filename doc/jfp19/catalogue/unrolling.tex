\subsection{Binding as self-reference: representing cyclic structures}\label{def:colist}

Ghani, Hamana, Uustalu and Vene~\citeyear{ghani2006representing} have
demonstrated how Altenkirch and Reus' type-level de Bruijn
indices~\citeyear{altenkirch1999monadic} can be used to represent
potentially cyclic structures by a finite object. In their
representation each bound variable is a pointer to the node
that introduced it. Given that we are, at the top-level, only
interested in structures with no ``dangling pointers'', we introduce
the notation \AF{TM} \AB{d} to mean closed terms (i.e. terms of type
\AD{Tm} \AB{d} \AF{∞} \AIC{[]}).

A basic example of such a structure is a potentially cyclic list which
offers a choice of two constructors: \AIC{[]} which ends the list and
\AIC{\_::\_} which combines a head and a tail but also acts as a binder
for a self-reference; these pointers can be used by using the \AIC{var}
constructor which we have renamed \AIC{↶} (pronounced ``backpointer'')
to match the domain-specific meaning.
We can see this approach in action in the examples
\AF{[0, 1]} and \AF{01↺} (pronounced ``0-1-cycle'') which describe
respectively a finite list containing
0 followed by 1 and a cyclic list starting with 0, then 1, and then
repeating the whole list again by referring to the first cons cell
represented here by the de Bruijn variable 1 (i.e. \AIC{s} \AIC{z}).

These finite representations are interesting in their own right
and we can use the generic semantics framework defined earlier
to manipulate them. A basic building block is the \AF{unroll}
function which takes a closed tree, exposes its top node and
unrolls any cycle which has it as its starting point. We can
decompose it using the \AF{plug} function which, given a closed
and an open term, closes the latter by plugging the former at
each free \AIC{`var} leaf. Noticing that \AF{plug}'s fundamental nature
is that of substituting a term for each leaf, it makes sense to
implement it by re-using the \AF{Substitution} semantics we already have.

However, one thing still out of our reach with our current tools is
the underlying cofinite trees these finite objects are meant to
represent. We start by defining the coinductive type corresponding to
them as the greatest fixpoint of a notion of layer. One layer of a
cofinite tree is precisely given by the meaning of its description
where we completely ignore the binding structure. We show with
\AF{01⋯} (mutually defined with \AF{10⋯}) the infinite list that
corresponds to the unfolding of the example \AF{01↺} given above.

%%%The definition proceeds by copattern-matching as introduced in
%%%\cite{abel2013copatterns} and showcased in \cite{thibodeau2016case}.

We can then make the connection between potentially cyclic
structures and the cofinite trees formal by giving an \AF{unfold}
function which, given a closed term, produces its unfolding.
The definition proceeds by unrolling the term's top layer and
co-recursively unfolding all the subterms.

Even if the
powerful notion of semantics described in Section~\ref{section:semantics}
cannot encompass all the traversals we may be interested in,
it provides us with reusable building blocks: the definition
of \AF{unfold} was made very simple by reusing the generic
program \AF{fmap} and the \AF{Substitution} semantics whilst
the definition of \AR{∞Tm} was made easy by reusing \AF{⟦\_⟧}.
