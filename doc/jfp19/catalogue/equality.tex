\subsection{Generic Decidable Equality for Terms}

If we forget the binding structure of syntaxes with binding, we are left with
standard inductive families. Haskell programmers are used to receiving help
from the `deriving' mechanism~\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/HinzeJ00,DBLP:conf/haskell/MagalhaesDJL10}.

In type theory we can do better than an uninformative boolean function claiming
that two terms are equal: we can implement a decision procedure for propositional
equality~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/LohM11} which either returns a proof that its two
inputs are equal or a proof that they cannot possibly be.
