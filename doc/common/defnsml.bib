abstract = {From the Publisher:Standard ML is general-purpose programming language designed for
large projects. This book provides a formal definition of Standard ML for the benefit
of all concerned with the language, including users and implementers. Because computer
programs are increasingly required to withstand rigorous analysis, it is all the more
important that the language in which they are written be defined with full rigor.
The authors have defined their semantic objects in mathematical notation that is completely
independent of Standard ML.}
